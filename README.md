Super simple blog using Node with Mongoose and Express

## Dependencies used: 
**-dompurify:** DOMPurify is a sanitizer for HTML, MathML and SVG. Written in JavaScript and works in all modern browsers.

**-express:** Express is a framework for Node. It makes everything fast and easy. 
              A useful feature of Express is creating routes which are used to navigate users to different parts of the application.
              
**-marked:** Marked is a low-level compiler for parsing markdown without caching or blocking for long periods of time.

**-method-override:** Allows you to use HTTP verbs such as PUT or DELETE in places where the client doesn't support it.

**-mongoose:** Mongoose provides a schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more.

**-slugify:** Replaces that super long, ugly id at the end of the URL (the part of the URL where you are accessing a resource,) with a cleaner, more readable slug using the title of your page. 
  
## DevDependencies used: 
**-nodemon:** Nodemon monitors any changes in your source and automatically restarts your server. Just use nodemon instead of node to run your code, and now your process will automatically restart when your code changes.
